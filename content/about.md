I was born in northeastern Ohio near Lake Erie. I studied a mix of <i class="fa fa-book"></i>literature, psychology, <i class="fa fa-calculator"></i>math, and history at <i class="fa fa-university"></i>[Miami University](http://muohio.edu/ "Miami University") and the [University of Illinois](http://uiuc.edu/ "University of Illinois"). I am an [INTJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTJ) and a <i class="fa fa-cutlery"></i>vegetarian who makes occasional lapses for sushi. I moved to the Pacific Northwest at the turn of the century for its <i class="fa fa-tree"></i>forests and rivers. I am father to <i class="fa fa-child"></i>Dante and partner to [Laure](http://xplusx.co/ "x plus x").
