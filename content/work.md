Pragmatism, flexibility of method, [order without rigidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oak_and_the_Reed), <i class="fa fa-bar-chart"></i>data-driven decision making, and esprit de corps are common threads in my work. I've diverse skills in UX, <i class="fa fa-line-chart"></i>business analysis, development, QA, much <i class="fa fa-tasks"></i>project management, and company operations. I remain an [expert generalist](https://25iq.com/2016/03/12/richard-feynman-and-charlie-munger-expert-generalists/) because there is always more to learn in many domains.

I dwell at the intersection of production and project management, data analysis and business intelligence, and team leadership. I brake for <i class="fa fa-map-o"></i>[unusual maps](http://sashat.me/2017/06/03/roman-roads/), pedestrians crossing the <i class="fa fa-bicycle"></i>bicycle lane, a teammate needing help, and work that is innovative and full of challenge. Here's my <i class="fa fa-file-text-o"></i>[resume](files/cast-anthony-resume-cv.pdf).

Some favorite tools are [XFCE](http://www.xfce.org/) or [KDE](https://www.kde.org/) as <i class="fa fa-desktop"></i>desktop environment and [JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) or [LiquidPlanner](https://www.liquidplanner.com/) for all things production. I prefer <i class="fa fa-linux"></i>[Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) as a rolling release distribution and the triad of <i class="fa fa-area-chart"></i>[Python](https://www.python.org/), [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) and [seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html) for analysis. I'm digging deeper with [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org).
