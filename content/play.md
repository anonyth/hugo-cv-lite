I like running west at <i class="fa fa-moon-o"></i>dusk, reading speculative [fiction](https://goodreads.com/anonyth "my reading list"), and tracking developments in <i class="fa fa-table"></i>data science, cognitive psychology, game theory, and open source software. I abandoned brewing <i class="fa fa-beer"></i>beer in favor of making mead. The latest is a ginger [metheglin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead#Varieties "a mead with spice or herbs") over two years in the making. Bees are wonderful creatures.

I am an [avid player](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/user/voigtkampff/ "my profile at BoardGameGeek") of mainly European board games that involve <i class="fa fa-cubes"></i>economies of production, territories and <i class="fa fa-sitemap"></i>technology trees, variable player powers, and multiple <i class="fa fa-road"></i>paths to victory. Some favorites include [Trajan](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/102680/trajan "rule imperial Rome"), [Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/126163/tzolk-mayan-calendar "perplexing calendar wheels"), [Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/182028/through-ages-new-story-civilization "civilization creation"), and [Race for the Galaxy](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28143/race-galaxy "intergalactic engine construction").

I prefer two wheeled vehicles. I ride a 1996 <i class="fa fa-motorcycle"></i>[BMW R1100RS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_R1100RS). For human-powered transportation, I move between a late 1990s bonded aluminum Alan cyclocross-er with a flip-flop <i class="fa fa-cog"></i>single-speed hub and a bombproof [chromoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/41xx_steel) 1980s Nishiki racer. I've been over the handlebars twice in <i class="fa fa-ambulance"></i>dramatic fashion &mdash; just on bicycle.
